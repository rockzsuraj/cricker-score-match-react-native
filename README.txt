Added react-native-safe-area-context because it is required as per doc to react-native-elements to work properly.

Please consider using following command before testing the app

Cd iOS && pod install
This install pod and will insure that all dependencies installed for iOS and and is link properly.

I have deleted the pods folder in iOS folder because size of zip was increased to 500mb
